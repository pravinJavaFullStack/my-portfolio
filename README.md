# my-portfolio
A personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my profile, skills, and projects as a Java Full Stack Developer. It includes an "About Me" section, project highlights (Java, Python, Spring Boot), and a functional contact form with client-side validation using JavaScript.
